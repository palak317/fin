# 🚀 FINWISE AI | The Intelligent Financial Cockpit

**FinWise AI** is a next-generation financial dashboard that bridges the gap between static bank statements, real-time spending, and AI-driven investment strategy. It combines **Generative AI (Gemini)** with **Live Market Data (Yahoo Finance)** and **WhatsApp integration** to create a seamless financial ecosystem.


## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. 🧠 Neural Analyzer (Statement Decryption)
* **Problem:** Bank statements are messy PDFs that are hard to analyze manually.
* **Solution:** Upload any PDF bank statement. Our **Gemini AI** model extracts transactions, categorizes them (Food, Travel, Investment) automatically, and visualizes spending patterns in interactive 3D charts.

### 2. 🔮 Wealth Oracle (Real-Time Strategy)
* **Problem:** AI usually gives generic financial advice without knowing current market prices.
* **Solution:** A hybrid engine. Gemini generates the *strategy* (e.g., "Buy Tata Motors"), and Python fetches the **Live Real-Time Price** from the NSE via Yahoo Finance to calculate exactly how many shares you can afford based on your budget.

### 3. 📲 Live Tracker (WhatsApp Bridge)
* **Problem:** Budgeting apps fail because opening them is a chore.
* **Solution:** A dedicated **Twilio Webhook**. Just text *"Spent 200 on Coffee"* on WhatsApp, and the dashboard updates instantly without you ever opening the website.
